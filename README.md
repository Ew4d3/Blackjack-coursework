Newtst.py is main file , other are test files for other things i was trying or older versions still saved in this area for quick access.
will need to change directory for png files as they are specific to my path as of now , need to figure out how to make it the same for everyone without it breaking on my mac laptop/and or windows pc.

creating this for my project was quite a big step up from my gcse work , as this was mainly terminal based things such as number ganerators , atm machine w/ no gui etc . 
now having to create and firiliarise myself w/ the use and creation of GUI's was a jump , but one i have made successfully , as i am now confident with creating a GUI in python using tkinter.

this still isnt done and needs to be updated , but this is where it is currently at . i got signifcantly aheed during the summer holidays and went and wrote the code , before we had finished our analysis section 
in the NEA , therfore i will need to re write this in an OOP structure , as the main purpose of this current code was to firmiliarise myself w/ tkinter and how the game would be structured , helping me in the
design section of the NEA. 





previous files before this 1/10/24 are saved on pc .
